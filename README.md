# SVG_Hexagonal_Grid
Create a grid of dynamically resizing hexagons with variables elements.

To use:

## In hexagon.php:
Set the number of hexagons to be stored int he $NUM_HEXAGONS variable

## In hexagon.js:
Set the number of hexagons that you want to appear in the larger column (since one column will have 1 less hexagon than another due to the tessalation) using the NUM_COL variable.
Set the total number of hexagons that you want to appear using the NUM_HEX variable
Set the space in pixels that you would like between the hexagons using the SPACER variable

If you want the hexagons to be smaller, than decrease the FACTOR variable.
If you would like the hexagons to tbe larger, than increase the FACTOR variable.
